# SSW Rules GPT 🤖

### 📝 Project Description

Our project is a GPT Bot that uses OpenAI embeddings to search for matching [SSW Rules](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules), and then feeding the top 10 results back into the ChatGPT API, written in C# and Blazor.

### 💻 Installation

Follow these simple steps to install and set up our SSW Rules GPT project:

1. Clone the repository
2. Create an appsettings.json file in `src/WebAPI` using the following template:
```
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Database.Command": "Information"
    }
  },
  "SigningAuthority": "https://identity.ssw.com.au",
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "{{ Supabase DB Connection String }}",
    "LocalConnection": "Host=localhost;Database=SswRules;Username=postgres;Password=postgres;Include Error Detail=true",
  },
  "OpenAiApiKey": "{{ SSW OpenAI API Key }}"
}
```
3. If you are running Identity Server locally, add the local SigningAuthority to your appsettings.Development.json:
```
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "SigningAuthority": "https://localhost:5003"
}
```   
4. Run the WebAPI (https) project
5. Run the WebUI (https) project, and a browser window will open to https://localhost:5002
   
> **Warning**  
> RulesGPT has been changed from port 5001 to 5002, if you are running Identity Server locally you **must** be running on port 5002.  
> Double check WebUI/launchsettings.json before running the project.

6. Ask SSW Rules GPT a question!

### 💻 Installation - Set Multiple Startup Projects
Instead of manually launching the WebUI and WebAPI projects, you can set multiple startup projects in Visual Studio and Rider.  
Read [this rule](https://ssw.com.au/rules/multiple-startup-projects/) to learn how.
